This project talks about a business Idea of a boutique hotel in downtown Chicago that celebrates the city's rich history and culture. The hotel will offer guests a unique, personalized experience and display local cuisine, art, and design.
And My market research talks about breakfast options based on survey research, that people prefer to have in the morning. This gives me data on the type of ingredients and menu items I can order for the hottels restuarant.
